SECTION 3 - ACCOMPLISHMENTS/ACHIEVEMENTS

- Verizon - The ETL system was flawed. IT clients did not trust the
Data Warehouse data and didn't use it.  I made major changes to the
ETL system with a very good result. After my changes users began to
trust the Data Warehouse and use it.  I designed the changes, led the
programming team that made the changes, managed the cutover.

- Verizon/Telecel - Designed and programmed the Bill Printing subsystem
to a successful result. Primary input was raw call data and final
output was printed bills, fulfilled (stuffed) into mailing envelopes. This was
a complex, multi-step process.

Encore Credit - Designed/Architected their first Data Warehouse system.

SAG-PPHP - With data from the Data Warehouse, designed and programmed a system 
that followed US Government specs so that SAG-PPHP could get
reimbursed for claims paid out to "Early Retirees", as part of the 
Government's ERRP (Early Retiree Reimbusement Program). Result was the
largest such reimbursement made to any Entertainment Industry Health Care
company.  The system survived all Government audits.
